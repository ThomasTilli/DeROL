## General Information
This dataset contains network session summary records
The raw network packets of the UNSW-NB 15 data set was created by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS) for generating a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviours.

## Download
1. Go to: https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/unsw-canberra-cyber/cybersecurity/ADFA-NB15-Datasets/
2. Download any .csv files you wish to work with, UNSW-NB15_2.csv, UNSW-NB15_3.csv were used in this study

## Folder Structure Preparation
1. Column 45 (for excel - AV) has the attack name or blank for normal behavior - will be reffered as "Record Category"
2. Partition the file by record category, with the following rules
    a. file names start with capital letter, normal records is called "Normal"
    b. files for train should be called <category>_UNSW.csv - example Generic_UNSW.csv
    c. files for test should be called <category>test__UNSW.csv - example Shellcode_test_UNSW.csv
    d. all categorical and time columns (1,2,3,4,5,6,14,21,22,45,46) should be deleted
    e. files should not contain any headers
3. Pass the parent directory with all the files when running the algorithm
